place all your js files in src/js and import them to main.js

place all your stylesheets to src/css/ and import them to main.scss

you only need one js import and one css import to the index file like in this example,
DO not add 10 different files to create a dependency hell

you can add 3rd party dependencies by following the example of how jQuery
is added in webpack.config.js

* run npm run build for static front end development

* run npm build:prod for production environment and backend integration
